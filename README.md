## Introduction

Welcome to the NFT App â€“ your gateway to exploring, creating, and trading Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This application seamlessly integrates a Solidity-based smart contract for token management and leverages Firebase for user authentication.

## Installation

To get started with the NFT App, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-app.git
   cd nft-app
2. Install dependencies: 

   ```bash
   npm install 

  This will install all the necessary packages and dependencies required for the NFT App to run smoothly. 


3. Configure Firebase: 

  - Create a Firebase project: Firebase Console 

  - Obtain your Firebase configuration and replace the placeholders in src/firebase.js with your actual credentials. 


4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start

  This will start the development server, and you can access the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser. 
  
## Functionalities 
   ## Smart Contract Integration 
   The NFT App integrates a Solidity-based smart contract for managing NFTs. Please note that the Solidity contract is currently a work in progress, and active development is ongoing to enhance and optimize its
   functionalities. Feel free to contribute to the contract development by checking the contracts directory for the latest updates. 
## Firebase Authentication 
   User authentication is implemented using Firebase Authentication. Users can securely sign up, log in, and reset their passwords. Firebase handles authentication-related tasks, ensuring a smooth and secure 
   experience for users interacting with the NFT App.

## Usage 

### 1. Sign Up / Log In: 
  Open the app and create an account using the sign-up form.  Existing users can log in using their credentials.

### 2. Explore NFTs: 
  Browse through the available NFTs on the platform.  View detailed information about each NFT, including ownership and transaction history. 

### 3. Create NFTs: 
  Users can create their own NFTs by following the simple creation process. Define metadata, upload images, and set ownership and trading preferences. 

### 4. Trade NFTs: 
  Engage in buying and selling NFTs with other users on the platform. Smart contract ensures secure and transparent transactions. 

### 5. Manage Account: 
   Users can update their profiles, change passwords, and manage their created NFTs.
